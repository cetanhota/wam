This is my new project to replace my current Raspberry Pi 3B. This is still very much a work in progress.

I wanted to share what I have completed so far.

This time I used a Arduino Wifi Uno rev 2. I like this board more memory the WiFI is very easy to setup and compatibility does not seem to be an issue.

There are two new sensors in this build.

1. BMP180
2. Adafruit Analog UV Sensor.

This is the current wiring setup.
